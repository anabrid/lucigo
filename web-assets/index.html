    TODO: Can make this a template which is enriched from runtime
          with actual information. Which also can be a proper
          redirect to the GUI, if available.

          The redirect should be a meta tag with nonzero timeout so
          browser caches don't get mad at developing.

    <h1>LUCIGO Webserver</h1>
    <p>This file is served by <a href="https://github.com/anabrid/lucigo">LUCIGO</a>,
    the administrative client for the digital-analog computer
    <a href="https://anabrid.com/lucidac">LUCIDAC</a> written by anabrid.
    <p>Machine readable information about the hosting situation is available
        at <a href="/.well-known/lucidac.json">/.well-known/lucidac.json</a>.
        Typically, there is a websocket endpoint at <tt>/ws</tt>
        and the LUCIDAC GUI files are available at <a href="/lucigui">lucigui</a>.
        This is also where you want to head to.
    </p>
    <p>However, if you see this page it typically means that the Lucigui is not
       embedded. You can, however, head over to <a href="https://lucidac.online/">lucidac.online</a>
       and enjoy the GUI there.
